# MicroML-WattGuard

ðŸ’¡ A lightweight Machine Learning framework designed for real-time anomaly detection in smart energy systems using low-power microcontrollers like ESP32 and Raspberry Pi.

 ðŸš€ Overview
This project explores how unsupervised ML algorithms can detect unusual power consumption patterns directly on embedded devices â€” enabling smarter, low-latency, and decentralized energy monitoring.

 ðŸ“Š Key Features
- Isolation Forestâ€“based anomaly detection
- Trained on UCI Household Power Consumption dataset
- Optimized for Raspberry Pi and ESP32
- Inference latency < 100ms
- Precision > 90% in simulated test environments

 ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib
- Google Colab (development)
- Raspberry Pi / ESP32 (target deployment)
